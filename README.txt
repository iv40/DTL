After downloading the files go into the "DodgeTheLines" folder and launch the "index.html" file to play the game.


CONTROLS: Arrow keys to move the block, pressing the "SPACE" key will activate your special ability (you become smaller so you can dodge the lines better). Picking up the red squares gives you a special ability charge.

Goal of the game: Avoid the lines and try to last as long as you can.


I made the game in couple of days so it is a bit rough, hope you enjoy :)
